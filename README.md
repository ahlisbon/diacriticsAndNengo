# Macrons & Nengo
A set of simple macros to quickly type romanized Japanese vowels with macrons (ex: ō) and Korean vowels with breves (ex: ŭ). It also allows for quick "on the fly" conversion of Western years to Japanese imperial era years (nengō/年号) and vice versa. These macros were created in AutoHotKey (AHK) and are contatined in a self executing file that launches a tiny stand alone program in the background. The scripts are run by pressing specific key combinations, for example: the right "alt" key and the "o" key to type "ō"
