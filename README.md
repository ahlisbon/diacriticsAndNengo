# Macrons & Nengō
A set of simple macros to quickly type romanized Japanese vowels with macrons (ex: ō) and Korean vowels with breves (ex: ŭ). It also allows for quick "on the fly" conversion of Western years to [Japanese imperial era years (nengō/年号)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_era_name#Neng%C5%8D_in_modern_Japan) and vice versa. These macros were created in [AutoHotKey (AHK)](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and are contatined in a self executing file that launches a tiny stand alone program in the background. The scripts are run by pressing specific key combinations, for example: the right "alt" key with the "o" key to type "ō".

## Features include:
- Quickly type vowels with macrons in [Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_romanization) romanization.
  - Including the ¥ symbol.
- Quckly type a breve (ŏ) for romanizing Korean in [McCune–Reischauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCune%E2%80%93Reischauer) romanization.
  - Including the ₩ symbol.
- Simplifies switching the Input Method Editor (IME) between English and typing in Japanese to only using the Caps Lock key.
- Quick Western ⇄ Nengō conversion from 1868 onward.
